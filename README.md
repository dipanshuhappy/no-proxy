Here we developed an Application - "Blockchain based Attendance Management System using NFC's."
This is not only useful in School/College levels this is also useful at one-day sessions, hackathons and etc.....
But, now i will explain how to use in college level, mostly process is same for everywhere.
let's get into it.

Requirements:
- Metamask wallet.
- NFC Support.

Note: 
  I am not specifing everywhere that they need to confirm metamask transaction.
  
Students need to register with their respective enrollment/student_id.

Now faculty can create a session and can add the timings of the attendnace....
faculty can add start and end timings of the attendance so, that attendance will be marked in only that time intervals.
after clicking the create session, faculty need to tap with nfc tag.
then, the complete data of that session will be stored in that nfc tag, as a faculty he done with his work and the faculty need to give that nfc to students...
then students will go to home page.....

students need to click on "Start Scan" and need to tap nfc with their mobile, then their attendance will be marked...

faculty will check attendance in session tab by enterning the session id.
